### The Dragonfly Inn Styleguide -
A style guide for a mock Bed and Breakfast website.
I created this style guide as a study in brand design and a place to practice styling reusable web components.

Notes:
- I plan to convert this to a react app in the near future. As the file grows, this will help with maintainability.
- This website was built purely for professional development. I recieve no profit from this site. Images and fonts have been sourced freely from Pinterest and dafont.
- Yes, I am a huge GG fan. Let me know if you'd like to see a style guide for other popular Stars Hollow haunts in the future :)
